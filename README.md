# ☸️ Kubernetes Learning Project (via Boot.dev)

This repository contains YAML configuration files and deployment specs created as part of the **Kubernetes course on Boot.dev**. The course focused on mastering the **core concepts of Kubernetes** by setting up and interacting with a local node using **Minikube** and the **command line interface**.

## 📚 Course Summary

The Boot.dev Kubernetes course covered:
- The architecture and purpose of Kubernetes
- How to use `kubectl` to create, inspect, and manage Pods, Deployments, and Services
- Writing and applying YAML manifests for deployments and configuration
- Working with Minikube to simulate a local Kubernetes cluster
- Key concepts like scaling, rolling updates, and pod lifecycle

## 🧰 About This Repository

This repo serves as a workspace for the YAML files used throughout the course. These include:
- Deployment exampls
- Service examples
- ConfigMap and volume usage examples

The Minikube node built during the course was temporary and not intended for production use—but it provided a great learning experience and hands-on exposure to working with Kubernetes in a safe local environment.

## 🎯 Why I Took This Course

I completed this course to strengthen my skills in container orchestration as I work toward becoming a **Site Reliability Engineer (SRE)**. Kubernetes is an industry-standard tool for managing scalable, reliable systems, and this course helped me build a strong foundation in its core workflows.

🧪 **Note:** This project is purely educational. The cluster created during the course is ephemeral and was designed for hands-on learning only.
